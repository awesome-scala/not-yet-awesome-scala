# Not-Yet-Awesome Scala

A curated list of Scala code and resources that do **NOT** exist yet, but would be beneficial to the Scala community.

The purpose of this list is twofold:

* Enumerate **specific use cases and their problems domains** that do not yet have a robust ecosystem in Scala.
    * The definition of "specific" and "robust" for this list is yet to be determined!
* Encourage the Scala community to approach gaps in the Scala ecosystem by providing this list as a point of collaboration!

You can jump right into editing this file [here](https://github.com/awesome-scala/not-yet-awesome-scala/edit/master/README.md). See the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on what you can do to help or if you have questions about this list!

# Table of contents

- [Ecosystem Infrastructure](#ecosystem-infrastructure)
- [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous)

## Ecosystem Infrastructure

* A repository to publish libraries to, which is free for users, and *dead simple* to publish to. This should be in a similar vein to what already exists in other ecosystems listed below:
   * Clojure: https://clojars.org/
   * Rust: https://crates.io/
   * JavaScript: https://www.npmjs.com/
   * Python: https://pypi.org/
   
   Scala does already have an indexing service, called Scaladex at https://index.scala-lang.org/, but this simply indexes existing libraries hosted on Maven Central, which is tedious and non-trivial to publish to. Scala needs a dead simple repository + index solution, which is as low-friction as Github/Gitlab to create libraries, or any of the projects listed above. 

## Miscellaneous

* Programming language detector - examples from Ruby, Python and Go are [linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist), 
[guesslang](https://github.com/yoeo/guesslang) and [enry](https://github.com/src-d/enry).
