# Not-Yet-Awesome Scala

A curated list of Scala code and resources that do **NOT** exist yet, but would be beneficial to the Scala community.

The purpose of this list is twofold:

* Enumerate **specific use cases and their problems domains** that do not yet have a robust ecosystem in Scala.
    * The definition of "specific" and "robust" for this list is yet to be determined!
* Encourage the Scala community to approach gaps in the Scala ecosystem by providing this list as a point of collaboration!

You can jump right into editing this file [here](https://github.com/awesome-scala/awesome-scala/edit/master/README.md). See the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on what you can do to help or if you have questions about this list!
